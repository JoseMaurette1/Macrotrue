I want to implement protected routes in my project so the first thing i want to do is to Implement logic to make sure that if the user isnt authenticated by clerk that they can't access certain Directories.

Directories that should not be accessed include

["Home", "Workout", "Calculator", "Food"]

Future updates will make it so that they can't access "Workout" if they are not a premium member.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create route protection middleware using Clerk's clerkMiddleware
2. Implement redirection logic for unauthenticated users
3. Configure protected routes to match specified directories
4. Add client-side protection using AuthGuard components
5. Add premium member check for "Workout" routes (future)
6. Test all protection scenarios

## Implementation Status Checklist

- [x] Fix middleware.ts to use clerkMiddleware with proper route protection
- [x] Configure protected routes (Home, Workout, Calculator, Food)
- [x] Implement redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- [x] Create AuthGuard component for client-side protection
- [x] Add layouts with AuthGuard to all protected routes
- [x] Add debug logging to diagnose issues
- [x] Create test page for verification
- [x] Test protection for all routes
- [ ] Implement premium membership check for Workout routes (future)

## How It Works

1. The middleware uses createRouteMatcher to check if the requested path matches any protected route (server-side protection)
2. If a protected route is accessed without authentication, the user is redirected to login
3. Each protected route has a layout.tsx file that implements the AuthGuard component (client-side protection)
4. The AuthGuard checks the authentication status and redirects to login if the user is not authenticated
5. For premium routes (future implementation), users without premium membership will be redirected to the pricing page

## Troubleshooting Notes

- We implemented a dual-layer protection approach:
  1. Server-side protection via middleware
  2. Client-side protection via AuthGuard component
- This ensures that users cannot access protected routes even if there are issues with the middleware
- Debug logging has been added to help diagnose authentication issues
- Protected routes now match exact paths and patterns with trailing slashes to ensure proper protection
- Common issues might include:
  - Path matching patterns not being specific enough
  - Clerk authentication state not being properly checked
  - Client-side navigation allowing access to protected routes
